In this seminar talk, we discussed the local and global convergence of Newton Methods topics which are under as follows:

* Lipschitz Condition, Contraction map, Convex set, Convex function
* Newton Methods: local convergence of Newton Methods, theorems, proof of quadratic convergence, and its advantages and drawbacks.
* Global convergence theorems, Banach Fixed Point Theorem, globalization schemes
* Modified Newton Method with Exact Line Search:
    * Global Convergence Results for Modified Newton Method with Exact Line Search
* Modified Newton Method with Inexact Line Search:
    * Global Convergence Results for Modified Newton Method with Inexact Line Search and their proofs
* Quasi Newton Methods:
    * Global Convergence Results for Quasi-Newton Method (BFGS) 
    * Global Convergence Results for Quasi-Newton Method (A Subclass of Oren-Luenberger)
 * Conclusions for Local- and Global- Properties of Newton Methods
