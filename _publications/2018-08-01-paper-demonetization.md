Abstract
======

Social media platforms, owing to its great wealth of information, facilitates one’s opportunities to explore hidden 
patterns or unknown correlations. It also finds its credibility in understanding people’s expressions from what they are
discussing on online platforms. As one showcase, in this paper, we summarize the dataset of Twitter messages related to
recent demonetization of all Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes in India and explore insights from Twitter’s data. Our proposed
system automatically extracts the popular latent topics in conversations regarding demonetization discussed in Twitter
via the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based topic model and also identifies the correlated topics across different
categories. Additionally, it also discovers people’s opinions expressed through their tweets related to the event under
consideration via the emotion analyzer. The system also employs an intuitive and informative visualization to show the
uncovered insight. Furthermore, we use an evaluation measure, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), to select the best
LDA models. The obtained LDA results show that the tool can be effectively used to extract discussion topics and summarize
them for further manual analysis.
