About Me
======

I have a MS degree in Scientific Computing at Heidelberg University, Germany and posses 4 years of experience in ML 
and software development. I have previously worked in Nuremberg, Germany as a Machine Learning Engineer where I worked
extensively in agile scrum machine learning engineering development and mentoring junior engineers for agile processes,
code reviews, and organizing KT sessions. I’m currently seeking for ML and data science full-time opportunities across
EMEA to start from Q1 2023.

I pursued my MSc thesis at SAP AI in Berlin where I worked on problems related to neural source code generation
from natural language and code completion. Prior to joining SAP AI Foundations in Berlin, I worked for one and half years
at SAP as Data Scientist & Developer in Walldorf, Germany since June 2019 where I was involved in agile software 
development (Python, Node.js, Jenkins CI/CD, Kubernetes, Docker, SonarQube)and delivering end-to-end ML (Pandas, Numpy,
Seaborn, Tensorflow) PoC to customers for commodity code prediction, master data record categorisation, and automatic
labelling of web documents using doc2vec and clustering. Prior to coming to Germany, 
I worked as Research Scholar at IIT Kanpur in India for 1 year.

Being industrious, determined, smart and passionate, I am always excited to take on new challenges and pursue new
learning opportunities.
